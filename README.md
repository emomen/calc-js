# calc-js

A calculator written in JavaScript and React.

This project is loosely based on the one from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator). However, there are some differences. For example, this version of the calculator is able to evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time but does not offer any keyboard support.
